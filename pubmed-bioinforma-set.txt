TI  - Bioinformatics in translational drug discovery.

AB  - Bioinformatics approaches are becoming ever more essential in translational drug 
      discovery both in academia and within the pharmaceutical industry. Computational 
      exploitation of the increasing volumes of data generated during all phases of drug 
      discovery is enabling key challenges of the process to be addressed. Here, we 
      highlight some of the areas in which bioinformatics resources and methods are being 
      developed to support the drug discovery pipeline. These include the creation of 
      large data warehouses, bioinformatics algorithms to analyse 'big data' that identify 
      novel drug targets and/or biomarkers, programs to assess the tractability of 
      targets, and prediction of repositioning opportunities that use licensed drugs to 
      treat additional indications.

AB  - Many publicly available data repositories and resources have been developed to 
      support protein-related information management, data-driven hypothesis generation, 
      and biological knowledge discovery. To help researchers quickly find the appropriate 
      protein-related informatics resources, we present a comprehensive review (with 
      categorization and description) of major protein bioinformatics databases in this 
      chapter. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for developing 
      next-generation protein bioinformatics databases and resources to support data 
      integration and data analytics in the Big Data era.

TI  - Bioinformatics Methods for Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics Data Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21082873 [doi]
LID - 2873
AB  - Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics have enabled tremendous 
      progress in the understanding of cellular mechanisms, disease progression, and the 
      relationship between genotype and phenotype. Though many popular bioinformatics 
      methods in proteomics are derived from other omics studies, novel analysis 
      strategies are required to deal with the unique characteristics of proteomics data. 
      In this review, we discuss the current developments in the bioinformatics methods 
      used in proteomics and how they facilitate the mechanistic understanding of 
      biological processes. We first introduce bioinformatics software and tools designed 
      for mass spectrometry-based protein identification and quantification, and then we 
      review the different statistical and machine learning methods that have been 
      developed to perform comprehensive analysis in proteomics studies. We conclude with 
      a discussion of how quantitative protein data can be used to reconstruct protein 
      interactions and signaling networks.

AB  - Aptamers are short nucleic acid sequences capable of specific, high-affinity 
      molecular binding. They are isolated via SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by 
      Exponential Enrichment), an evolutionary process that involves iterative rounds of 
      selection and amplification before sequencing and aptamer characterization. As 
      aptamers are genetic in nature, bioinformatic approaches have been used to improve 
      both aptamers and their selection. This review will discuss the advancements made in 
      several enclaves of aptamer bioinformatics, including simulation of aptamer 
      selection, fragment-based aptamer design, patterning of libraries, identification of 
      lead aptamers from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data and in silico aptamer 
      optimization.

TI  - Microarray bioinformatics in cancer- a review.
PG  - 838-843
AB  - Bioinformatics is one of the newest fields of biological research, and should be 
      viewed broadly as the use of mathematical, statistical, and computational methods 
      for the processing and analysis of biological data. Over the last decade, the rapid 
      growth of information and technology in both "genomics" and "omics" eras has been 
      overwhelming for the laboratory scientists to process experimental results. 
      Traditional gene-by-gene approaches in research are insufficient to meet the growth 
      and demand of biological research in understanding the true biology. The massive 
      amounts of data generated by new technologies as genomic sequencing and microarray 
      chips make the management of data and the integration of multiple platforms of high 
      importance; this is then followed by data analysis and interpretation to achieve 
      biological understanding and therapeutic progress. Global views of analyzing the 
      magnitude of information are necessary and traditional approaches to lab work have 
      steadily been changing towards a bioinformatics era. Research is moving from being 
      restricted to a laboratory environment to working with computers in a "virtual lab" 
      environment. The present review article shall put light on this emerging field and 
      its applicability towards cancer research.

AB  - Microbial bioinformatics in 2020 will remain a vibrant, creative discipline, adding 
      value to the ever-growing flood of new sequence data, while embracing novel 
      technologies and fresh approaches. Databases and search strategies will struggle to 
      cope and manual curation will not be sustainable during the scale-up to the 
      million-microbial-genome era. Microbial taxonomy will have to adapt to a situation 
      in which most microorganisms are discovered and characterised through the analysis 
      of sequences. Genome sequencing will become a routine approach in clinical and 
      research laboratories, with fresh demands for interpretable user-friendly outputs. 
      The "internet of things" will penetrate healthcare systems, so that even a piece of 
      hospital plumbing might have its own IP address that can be integrated with pathogen 
      genome sequences. Microbiome mania will continue, but the tide will turn from 
      molecular barcoding towards metagenomics. Crowd-sourced analyses will collide with 
      cloud computing, but eternal vigilance will be the price of preventing the 
      misinterpretation and overselling of microbial sequence data. Output from hand-held 
      sequencers will be analysed on mobile devices. Open-source training materials will 
      address the need for the development of a skilled labour force. As we boldly go into 
      the third decade of the twenty-first century, microbial sequence space will remain 
      the final frontier!

AB  - Significance: Bioinformatics has brought important insights into the field of 
      selenium research. The progress made in the development of computational tools in 
      the last two decades, coordinated with growing genome resources, provided new 
      opportunities to study selenoproteins. The present review discusses existing tools 
      for selenoprotein gene finding and other bioinformatic approaches to study the 
      biology of selenium. Recent Advances: The availability of complete selenoproteomes 
      allowed assessing a global distribution of the use of selenocysteine (Sec) across 
      the tree of life, as well as studying the evolution of selenoproteins and their 
      biosynthetic pathway. Beyond gene identification and characterization, human genetic 
      variants in selenoprotein genes were used to examine adaptations to selenium levels 
      in diverse human populations and to estimate selective constraints against gene 
      loss. Critical Issues: The synthesis of selenoproteins is essential for development 
      in mice. In humans, several mutations in selenoprotein genes have been linked to 
      rare congenital disorders. And yet, the mechanism of Sec insertion and the 
      regulation of selenoprotein synthesis in mammalian cells are not completely 
      understood. Future Directions: Omics technologies offer new possibilities to study 
      selenoproteins and mechanisms of Sec incorporation in cells, tissues, and organisms.

AB  - Metagenomics has proven to be one of the most important research fields for 
      microbial ecology during the last decade. Starting from 16S rRNA marker gene 
      analysis for the characterization of community compositions to whole metagenome 
      shotgun sequencing which additionally allows for functional analysis, metagenomics 
      has been applied in a wide spectrum of research areas. The cost reduction paired 
      with the increase in the amount of data due to the advent of next-generation 
      sequencing led to a rapidly growing demand for bioinformatic software in 
      metagenomics. By now, a large number of tools that can be used to analyze 
      metagenomic datasets has been developed. The Bielefeld-Gießen center for microbial 
      bioinformatics as part of the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure 
      bundles and imparts expert knowledge in the analysis of metagenomic datasets, 
      especially in research on microbial communities involved in anaerobic digestion 
      residing in biogas reactors. In this review, we give an overview of the field of 
      metagenomics, introduce into important bioinformatic tools and possible workflows, 
      accompanied by application examples of biogas surveys successfully conducted at the 
      Center for Biotechnology of Bielefeld University.

AB  - PURPOSE: We explored the mechanism of aspirin in SCLC by dissecting many publicly 
      available databases. METHODS AND RESULTS: Firstly, 11 direct protein targets (DPTs) 
      of aspirin were identified by DrugBank 5.0. Then protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      network and signaling pathways of aspirin DPTs were analyzed. We found that aspirin 
      was linked with many kinds of cancer, and the most significant one is SCLC. Next, we 
      classified the mutation of 4 aspirin DPTs in SCLC (IKBKB, NFKBIA, PTGS2 and TP53) 
      using cBio Portal. Further, we identified top 50 overexpressed genes of SCLC by 
      Oncomine, and the interconnected genes with the 4 aspirin DPTs in SCLC (IKBKB, 
      NFKBIA, PTGS2 and TP53) by STRING. Lastly, we figured out 5 consistently genes as 
      potential therapeutic targets of aspirin in SCLC. CONCLUSION: The integrated 
      bioinformatical analysis could improve our understanding of the underlying molecular 
      mechanism about how aspirin working in SCLC. Integrated bioinformatical analysis may 
      be considered as a new paradigm for guiding future studies about interaction in 
      drugs and diseases.
