AB  - The β-lactams retain a central place in the antibacterial armamentarium. In 
      Gram-negative bacteria, β-lactamase enzymes that hydrolyze the amide bond of the 
      four-membered β-lactam ring are the primary resistance mechanism, with multiple 
      enzymes disseminating on mobile genetic elements across opportunistic pathogens such 
      as Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Escherichia coli) and non-fermenting organisms (e.g., 
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa). β-Lactamases divide into four classes; the active-site 
      serine β-lactamases (classes A, C and D) and the zinc-dependent or 
      metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs; class B). Here we review recent advances in mechanistic 
      understanding of each class, focusing upon how growing numbers of crystal 
      structures, in particular for β-lactam complexes, and methods such as neutron 
      diffraction and molecular simulations, have improved understanding of the 
      biochemistry of β-lactam breakdown. A second focus is β-lactamase interactions with 
      carbapenems, as carbapenem-resistant bacteria are of grave clinical concern and 
      carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes such as KPC (class A) NDM (class B) and OXA-48 (class 
      D) are proliferating worldwide. An overview is provided of the changing landscape of 
      β-lactamase inhibitors, exemplified by the introduction to the clinic of 
      combinations of β-lactams with diazabicyclooctanone and cyclic boronate serine 
      β-lactamase inhibitors, and of progress and strategies toward clinically useful MBL 
      inhibitors. Despite the long history of β-lactamase research, we contend that issues 
      including continuing unresolved questions around mechanism; opportunities afforded 
      by new technologies such as serial femtosecond crystallography; the need for new 
      inhibitors, particularly for MBLs; the likely impact of new β-lactam:inhibitor 
      combinations and the continuing clinical importance of β-lactams mean that this 
      remains a rewarding research area.

AB  - β-Lactam antibiotics are the most commonly used antibacterial agents and growing 
      resistance to these drugs is a concern. Metallo-β-lactamases are a diverse set of 
      enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a broad range of β-lactam drugs including 
      carbapenems. This diversity is reflected in the observation that the enzyme 
      mechanisms differ based on whether one or two zincs are bound in the active site 
      that, in turn, is dependent on the subclass of β-lactamase. The dissemination of the 
      genes encoding these enzymes among Gram-negative bacteria has made them an important 
      cause of resistance. In addition, there are currently no clinically available 
      inhibitors to block metallo-β-lactamase action. This review summarizes the numerous 
      studies that have yielded insights into the structure, function, and mechanism of 
      action of these enzymes.

TI  - Defining an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
PG  - 3-10
AB  - The term 'extended-spectrum beta-lactamase' (ESBL), initially 
      'extended-broad-spectrum beta-lactamase', was first coined for derivatives of TEM 
      and SHV enzymes able to hydrolyse oxyimino-cephalosporins. These all belonged to 
      beta-lactamase functional group 2be. Subsequently, the term has been stretched to 
      include: (i) enzymes with spectra similar to those of TEM and SHV mutants but 
      derived from other sources, e.g., the CTX-M and VEB types; (ii) TEM and SHV mutants 
      with borderline ESBL activity, e.g., TEM-12; and (iii) various beta-lactamases 
      conferring wider resistance than their parent types but not meeting the definition 
      for group 2be, e.g., OXA derivatives and mutant AmpC types with increased activity 
      against cefepime. It seems best-and pragmatic-that the term 'ESBL' retains its broad 
      modern usage, but that should always be accompanied by mention of the enzyme's 
      family as, e.g., in 'TEM ESBL' or 'OXA ESBL', not as a sole moniker.

AB  - β-Lactamases, the major resistance determinant for β-lactam antibiotics in 
      Gram-negative bacteria, are ancient enzymes whose origins can be traced back 
      millions of years ago. These well-studied enzymes, currently numbering almost 2,800 
      unique proteins, initially emerged from environmental sources, most likely to 
      protect a producing bacterium from attack by naturally occurring β-lactams. Their 
      ancestors were presumably penicillin-binding proteins that share sequence homology 
      with β-lactamases possessing an active-site serine. Metallo-β-lactamases also exist, 
      with one or two catalytically functional zinc ions. Although penicillinases in 
      Gram-positive bacteria were reported shortly after penicillin was introduced 
      clinically, transmissible β-lactamases that could hydrolyze recently approved 
      cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems later became important in Gram-negative 
      pathogens. Nomenclature is based on one of two major systems. Originally, functional 
      classifications were used, based on substrate and inhibitor profiles. A later scheme 
      classifies β-lactamases according to amino acid sequences, resulting in class A, B, 
      C, and D enzymes. A more recent nomenclature combines the molecular and biochemical 
      classifications into 17 functional groups that describe most β-lactamases. Some of 
      the most problematic enzymes in the clinical community include extended-spectrum 
      β-lactamases (ESBLs) and the serine and metallo-carbapenemases, all of which are at 
      least partially addressed with new β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. New enzyme 
      variants continue to be described, partly because of the ease of obtaining sequence 
      data from whole-genome sequencing studies. Often, these new enzymes are devoid of 
      any phenotypic descriptions, making it more difficult for clinicians and antibiotic 
      researchers to address new challenges that may be posed by unusual β-lactamases.

AB  - TEM-1 β-lactamase is one of the most well-known antibiotic resistance determinants 
      around. It confers resistance to penicillins and early cephalosporins and has shown 
      an astonishing functional plasticity in response to the introduction of novel drugs 
      derived from these antibiotics. Since its discovery in the 1960s, over 170 variants 
      of TEM-1 - with different amino acid sequences and often resistance phenotypes - 
      have been isolated in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Next to this well-documented 
      'natural' evolution, the in vitro evolution of TEM-1 has been the focus of attention 
      of many experimental studies. In this review, we compare the natural and laboratory 
      evolution of TEM-1 in order to address the question to what extent the evolution of 
      antibiotic resistance can be repeated, and hence might have been predicted, under 
      laboratory conditions. We also use the comparison to gain an insight into the 
      adaptive relevance of hitherto uncharacterized substitutions present in clinical 
      isolates and to predict substitutions not yet observed in nature. Based on new 
      structural insights, we review what is known about substitutions in TEM-1 that 
      contribute to the extension of its resistance phenotype. Finally, we address the 
      clinical relevance of TEM alleles during the past decade, which has been dominated 
      by the emergence of another β-lactamase, CTX-M.

TI  - Novel carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase, KPC-1, from a carbapenem-resistant 
      strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
PG  - 1151-61
AB  - A Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate showing moderate to high-level imipenem and 
      meropenem resistance was investigated. The MICs of both drugs were 16 microg/ml. The 
      beta-lactamase activity against imipenem and meropenem was inhibited in the presence 
      of clavulanic acid. The strain was also resistant to extended-spectrum 
      cephalosporins and aztreonam. Isoelectric focusing studies demonstrated three 
      beta-lactamases, with pIs of 7.2 (SHV-29), 6.7 (KPC-1), and 5.4 (TEM-1). The 
      presence of bla(SHV) and bla(TEM) genes was confirmed by specific PCRs and DNA 
      sequence analysis. Transformation and conjugation studies with Escherichia coli 
      showed that the beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.7, KPC-1 (K. pneumoniae 
      carbapenemase-1), was encoded on an approximately 50-kb nonconjugative plasmid. The 
      gene, bla(KPC-1), was cloned in E. coli and shown to confer resistance to imipenem, 
      meropenem, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and aztreonam. The amino acid sequence 
      of the novel carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase, KPC-1, showed 45% identity to 
      the pI 9.7 carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase, Sme-1, from Serratia marcescens 
      S6. Hydrolysis studies showed that purified KPC-1 hydrolyzed not only carbapenems 
      but also penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams. KPC-1 had the highest 
      affinity for meropenem. The kinetic studies also revealed that clavulanic acid and 
      tazobactam inhibited KPC-1. An examination of the outer membrane proteins of the 
      parent K. pneumoniae strain demonstrated that the strain does not express detectable 
      levels of OmpK35 and OmpK37, although OmpK36 is present. We concluded that 
      carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae strain 1534 is mainly due to production of a 
      novel Bush group 2f, class A, carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase, KPC-1, although 
      alterations in porin expression may also play a role.

PG  - 2153-62
AB  - Therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing 
      plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are 
      usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, 
      cefpirome, and the carbapenems. These organisms are a major concern in nosocomial 
      infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. Six families 
      of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic 
      test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance 
      and epidemiology studies. This report describes the development of a multiplex PCR 
      for the purpose of identifying family-specific AmpC beta-lactamase genes within 
      gram-negative pathogens. The PCR uses six sets of ampC-specific primers resulting in 
      amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel 
      electrophoresis. ampC multiplex PCR differentiated the six plasmid-mediated 
      ampC-specific families in organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, 
      Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Family-specific 
      primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampC genes. Furthermore, 
      this PCR-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. In addition, 
      WAVE technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was 
      used as a way of decreasing analysis time and increasing the sensitivity of 
      multiple-gene assays. In conclusion, a multiplex PCR technique was developed for 
      identifying family-specific ampC genes responsible for AmpC beta-lactamase 
      expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase gene.

TI  - beta-Lactamases in laboratory and clinical resistance.
PG  - 557-84
AB  - beta-Lactamases are the commonest single cause of bacterial resistance to 
      beta-lactam antibiotics. Numerous chromosomal and plasmid-mediated types are known 
      and may be classified by their sequences or phenotypic properties. The ability of a 
      beta-lactamase to cause resistance varies with its activity, quantity, and cellular 
      location and, for gram-negative organisms, the permeability of the producer strain. 
      beta-Lactamases sometimes cause obvious resistance to substrate drugs in routine 
      tests; often, however, these enzymes reduce susceptibility without causing 
      resistance at current, pharmacologically chosen breakpoints. This review considers 
      the ability of the prevalent beta-lactamases to cause resistance to widely used 
      beta-lactams, whether resistance is accurately reflected in routine tests, and the 
      extent to which the antibiogram for an organism can be used to predict the type of 
      beta-lactamase that it produces.

TI  - Fluorescent Mesoporous Nanoparticles for β-Lactamase Screening Assays.
PG  - 1074-1081

AB  - We present a sensitive and rapid screening method for the determination of 
      β-lactamase activity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, by designing a pH-sensitive 
      fluorescent dye-doped mesoporous silica nanoparticle encapsulated with penicillin G 
      as a substrate. When penicillin G was hydrolysed by β-lactamase and converted into 
      penicilloic acid, the acidic environment resulted in fluorescence quenching of the 
      dye. The dye-doped mesoporous nanoparticles not only enhanced the 
      β-lactamase-catalyzed reaction rate but also stablized the substrate, penicillin G, 
      which degrades into penicilloic acid in a water solution without β-lactamase. 
      Twentyfive clinical bacterial samples were tested and the antibiotic resistant and 
      susceptible strains were identified. The proposed method may detect the presence of 
      β -lactamases of clinically relevant samples in less than 1 hour. Moreover, the 
      detection limit of β-lactamase activity was as low as 7.8×10(-4) U/mL, which was 
      determined within two hours.

      in Enterobacteriaceae.

AB  - Despite being members of gut microbiota, Enterobacteriaceae are associated with many 
      severe infections such as bloodstream infections. The β-lactam drugs have been the 
      cornerstone of antibiotic therapy for such infections. However, the overuse of these 
      antibiotics has contributed to select β-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
      isolates, so that β-lactam resistance is nowadays a major concern worldwide. The 
      production of enzymes that inactivate β-lactams, mainly extended-spectrum 
      β-lactamases and carbapenemases, can confer multidrug resistance patterns that 
      seriously compromise therapeutic options. Further, β-lactam resistance may result in 
      increases in the drug toxicity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with 
      Enterobacteriaceae infections. Here, we summarize the updated evidence about the 
      molecular mechanisms and epidemiology of β-lactamase-mediated β-lactam resistance in 
      Enterobacteriaceae, and their potential impact on clinical outcomes of 
      β-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections.
