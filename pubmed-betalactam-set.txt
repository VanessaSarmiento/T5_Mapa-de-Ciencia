AB  - The fight against infectious diseases is probably one of the greatest public health 
      challenges faced by our society, especially with the emergence of 
      carbapenem-resistant gram-negatives that are in some cases pan-drug resistant. 
      Currently,β-lactamase-mediated resistance does not spare even the newest and most 
      powerful β-lactams (carbapenems), whose activity is challenged by carbapenemases. 
      The worldwide dissemination of carbapenemases in gram-negative organisms threatens 
      to take medicine back into the pre-antibiotic era since the mortality associated 
      with infections caused by these "superbugs" is very high, due to limited treatment 
      options. Clinically-relevant carbapenemases belong either to metallo-β- lactamases 
      (MBLs) of Ambler class B or to serine-β-lactamases (SBLs) of Ambler class A and D 
      enzymes. Class A carbapenemases may be chromosomally-encoded (SME, NmcA, SFC-1, 
      BIC-1, PenA, FPH-1, SHV-38), plasmid-encoded (KPC, GES, FRI-1) or both (IMI). The 
      plasmid-encoded enzymes are often associated with mobile elements responsible for 
      their mobilization. These enzymes, even though weakly related in terms of sequence 
      identities, share structural features and a common mechanism of action. They 
      variably hydrolyse penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, carbapenems, and are 
      inhibited by clavulanate and tazobactam. Three-dimensional structures of class A 
      carbapenemases, in the apo form or in complex with substrates/inhibitors, together 
      with site-directed mutagenesis studies, provide essential input for identifying the 
      structural factors and subtle conformational changes that influence the hydrolytic 
      profile and inhibition of these enzymes. Overall, these data represent the building 
      blocks for understanding the structure-function relationships that define the 
      phenotypes of class A carbapenemases and can guide the design of new molecules of 
      therapeutic interest.

      loop dynamics.

LID - e66567
AB  - Understanding allostery in enzymes and tools to identify it offer promising 
      alternative strategies to inhibitor development. Through a combination of 
      equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we identify 
      allosteric effects and communication pathways in two prototypical class A 
      β-lactamases, TEM-1 and KPC-2, which are important determinants of antibiotic 
      resistance. The nonequilibrium simulations reveal pathways of communication 
      operating over distances of 30 Å or more. Propagation of the signal occurs through 
      cooperative coupling of loop dynamics. Notably, 50% or more of clinically relevant 
      amino acid substitutions map onto the identified signal transduction pathways. This 
      suggests that clinically important variation may affect, or be driven by, 
      differences in allosteric behavior, providing a mechanism by which amino acid 
      substitutions may affect the relationship between spectrum of activity, catalytic 
      turnover, and potential allosteric behavior in this clinically important enzyme 
      family. Simulations of the type presented here will help in identifying and 
      analyzing such differences.

OAB - Antibiotics are crucial drugs for treating and preventing bacterial infections, but 
      some bacteria are evolving ways to resist their effects. This ‘antibiotic 
      resistance’ threatens lives and livelihoods worldwide. β-lactam antibiotics, like 
      penicillin, are some of the most commonly used, but some bacteria can now make 
      enzymes called β-lactamases, which destroy these antibiotics. Dozens of different 
      types of β-lactamases now exist, each with different properties. Two of the most 
      medically important are TEM-1 and KPC-2. One way to counteract β-lactamases is with 
      drugs called inhibitors that stop the activity of these enzymes. The approved 
      β-lactamase inhibitors work by blocking the part of the enzyme that binds and 
      destroys antibiotics, known as the 'active site'. The β-lactamases have evolved, 
      some of which have the ability to resist the effects of known inhibitors. It is 
      possible that targeting parts of β-lactamases far from the active site, known as 
      'allosteric sites', might get around these new bacterial defences. A molecule that 
      binds to an allosteric site might alter the enzyme's shape, or restrict its 
      movement, making it unable to do its job. Galdadas, Qu et al. used simulations to 
      understand how molecules binding at allosteric sites affect enzyme movement. The 
      experiments examined the structures of both TEM-1 and KPC-2, looking at how their 
      shapes changed as molecules were removed from the allosteric site. This revealed how 
      the allosteric sites and the active site are linked together. When molecules were 
      taken out of the allosteric sites, they triggered ripples of shape change that 
      travelled via loop-like structures across the surface of the enzyme. These loops 
      contain over half of the known differences between the different types of 
      β-lactamases, suggesting mutations here may be responsible for changing which 
      antibiotics each enzyme can destroy. In other words, changes in the 'ripples' may be 
      related to the ability of the enzymes to resist particular antibiotics. 
      Understanding how changes in one part of a β-lactamase enzyme reach the active site 
      could help in the design of new inhibitors. It might also help to explain how 
      β-lactamases evolve new properties. Further work could show why different enzymes 
      are more or less active against different antibiotics.

TI  - Kinetic and structural requirements for carbapenemase activity in GES-type 
      β-lactamases.
PG  - 588-97
LID - 10.1021/bi501052t [doi]
AB  - Carbapenems are the last resort antibiotics for treatment of life-threatening 
      infections. The GES β-lactamases are important contributors to carbapenem resistance 
      in clinical bacterial pathogens. A single amino acid difference at position 170 of 
      the GES-1, GES-2, and GES-5 enzymes is responsible for the expansion of their 
      substrate profile to include carbapenem antibiotics. This highlights the increasing 
      need to understand the mechanisms by which the GES β-lactamases function to aid in 
      development of novel therapeutics. We demonstrate that the catalytic efficiency of 
      the enzymes with carbapenems meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem progressively 
      increases (100-fold) from GES-1 to -5, mainly due to an increase in the rate of 
      acylation. The data reveal that while acylation is rate limiting for GES-1 and GES-2 
      for all three carbapenems, acylation and deacylation are indistinguishable for 
      GES-5. The ertapenem-GES-2 crystal structure shows that only the core structure of 
      the antibiotic interacts with the active site of the GES-2 β-lactamase. The 
      identical core structures of ertapenem, doripenem, and meropenem are likely 
      responsible for the observed similarities in the kinetics with these carbapenems. 
      The lack of a methyl group in the core structure of imipenem may provide a 
      structural rationale for the increase in turnover of this carbapenem by the GES 
      β-lactamases. Our data also show that in GES-2 an extensive hydrogen-bonding network 
      between the acyl-enzyme complex and the active site water attenuates activation of 
      this water molecule, which results in poor deacylation by this enzyme.

TI  - The complexed structure and antimicrobial activity of a non-beta-lactam inhibitor of 
      AmpC beta-lactamase.
PG  - 2330-7
AB  - Beta-lactamases are the major resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics and 
      pose a growing threat to public health. Recently, bacteria have become resistant to 
      beta-lactamase inhibitors, making this problem pressing. In an effort to overcome 
      this resistance, non-beta-lactam inhibitors of beta-lactamases were investigated for 
      complementarity to the structure of AmpC beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli. This 
      led to the discovery of an inhibitor, benzo(b)thiophene-2-boronic acid (BZBTH2B), 
      which inhibited AmpC with a Ki of 27 nM. This inhibitor is chemically dissimilar to 
      beta-lactams, raising the question of what specific interactions are responsible for 
      its activity. To answer this question, the X-ray crystallographic structure of 
      BZBTH2B in complex with AmpC was determined to 2.25 A resolution. The structure 
      reveals several unexpected interactions. The inhibitor appears to complement the 
      conserved, R1-amide binding region of AmpC, despite lacking an amide group. 
      Interactions between one of the boronic acid oxygen atoms, Tyr150, and an ordered 
      water molecule suggest a mechanism for acid/base catalysis and a direction for 
      hydrolytic attack in the enzyme catalyzed reaction. To investigate how a 
      non-beta-lactam inhibitor would perform against resistant bacteria, BZBTH2B was 
      tested in antimicrobial assays. BZBTH2B significantly potentiated the activity of a 
      third-generation cephalosporin against AmpC-producing resistant bacteria. This 
      inhibitor was unaffected by two common resistance mechanisms that often arise 
      against beta-lactams in conjunction with beta-lactamases. Porin channel mutations 
      did not decrease the efficacy of BZBTH2B against cells expressing AmpC. Also, this 
      inhibitor did not induce expression of AmpC, a problem with many beta-lactams. The 
      structure of the BZBTH2B/AmpC complex provides a starting point for the 
      structure-based elaboration of this class of non-beta-lactam inhibitors.

AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamases (MbetaLs) constitute an increasingly serious clinical threat 
      by giving rise to beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. They accommodate in their 
      catalytic pocket one or two zinc ions, which are responsible for the hydrolysis of 
      beta-lactams. Recent x-ray studies on a member of the mono-zinc B2 MbetaLs, CphA 
      from Aeromonas hydrophila, have paved the way to mechanistic studies of this 
      important subclass, which is selective for carbapenems. Here we have used hybrid 
      quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical methods to investigate the enzymatic 
      hydrolysis by CphA of the antibiotic biapenem. Our calculations describe the entire 
      reaction and point to a new mechanistic description, which is in agreement with the 
      available experimental evidence. Within our proposal, the zinc ion properly orients 
      the antibiotic while directly activating a second catalytic water molecule for the 
      completion of the hydrolytic cycle. This mechanism provides an explanation for a 
      variety of mutagenesis experiments and points to common functional facets across B2 
      and B1 MbetaLs.

      reaction: an EPR spectrokinetic study of Co(II)-spin label interactions.

AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamases are responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance on 
      certain pathogenic bacteria. In consequence, the search for inhibitors that may be 
      useful in combating antibiotic resistance has fueled much study of the active sites 
      of these enzymes. There exists circumstantial evidence that the binding of 
      substrates and inhibitors to metallo-beta-lactamases may involve binding to the 
      organic part of the molecule, in addition to or prior to binding to one or more 
      active site metal ions. It has also been postulated that a conformational change may 
      accompany this putative binding. In the present study, electron paramagnetic 
      resonance spectrokinetic study of a spin-labeled variant of the class B2 
      metallo-beta-lactamase ImiS identified movement of a component residue on a 
      conserved alpha-helix in a catalytically competent time upon formation of a 
      transient reaction intermediate with the substrate imipenem. In a significant 
      subpopulation of ImiS, this conformational change was not associated with substrate 
      binding to the active site metal ion but, rather, represents a distinct step in the 
      reaction with ImiS. This observation has implications regarding the determinants of 
      substrate specificity in metallo-beta-lactamases and the design of potentially 
      clinically useful inhibitors.

TI  - Discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of multidrug-resistance plasmid maintenance 
      using a high-throughput screening approach.
PG  - 29839-29850

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are multidrug-resistant pathogens for 
      which new treatments are desperately needed. Carbapenemases and other types of 
      antibiotic resistance genes are carried almost exclusively on large, low-copy-number 
      plasmids (pCRE). Accordingly, small molecules that efficiently evict pCRE plasmids 
      should restore much-needed treatment options. We therefore designed a 
      high-throughput screen to identify such compounds. A synthetic plasmid was 
      constructed containing the plasmid replication machinery from a representative 
      Escherichia coli CRE isolate as well as a fluorescent reporter gene to easily 
      monitor plasmid maintenance. The synthetic plasmid was then introduced into an E. 
      coli K12 tolC host. We used this screening strain to test a library of over 12,000 
      known bioactive agents for molecules that selectively reduce plasmid levels relative 
      to effects on bacterial growth. From 366 screen hits we further validated the 
      antiplasmid activity of kasugamycin, an aminoglycoside; CGS 15943, a nucleoside 
      analog; and Ro 90-7501, a bibenzimidazole. All three compounds exhibited significant 
      antiplasmid activity including up to complete suppression of plasmid replication 
      and/or plasmid eviction in multiple orthogonal readouts and potentiated activity of 
      the carbapenem, meropenem, against a strain carrying the large, pCRE plasmid from 
      which we constructed the synthetic screening plasmid. Additionally, we found 
      kasugamycin and CGS 15943 blocked plasmid replication, respectively, by inhibiting 
      expression or function of the plasmid replication initiation protein, RepE. In 
      summary, we validated our approach to identify compounds that alter plasmid 
      maintenance, confer resensitization to antimicrobials, and have specific mechanisms 
      of action.

TI  - Oligonucleotide microarray for the identification of carbapenemase genes of 
      molecular classes a, B, and d.
PG  - 101-9
AB  - This work is a report on the development of a method of hybridization analysis on 
      DNA microarrays for the simultaneous identification and typing of 
      carbapenemase-encoding genes. These enzymes are produced by the microorganisms that 
      are responsible for causing infectious diseases. The method involves several steps, 
      including DNA extraction from clinical samples and amplification of carbapenemase 
      genes by multiplex PCR with simultaneous labelling by biotin. Following that, 
      hybridization of the labeled PCR products with oligonucleotide probes immobilized on 
      the surface of a nitrocellulose-based DNA microarray occurs. The biotin molecules 
      attached to the DNA duplexes are detected by using conjugates of 
      streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, which is then quantified by colorimetric 
      detection of the enzyme. We have designed the required oligonucleotide probes and 
      optimized the conditions of the membrane microarray-based hybridization analysis. 
      Our method allows to identify 7 types of carbapenemase genes belonging to the 
      molecular classes A, B, and D, and it also allows additional typing into genetic 
      subgroups. The microarrays have been tested with the control strains producing the 
      carbapenemase genes which have been characterized by sequencing. The developed 
      method of hybridization analysis was employed to investigate clinical strains 
      ofPseudomonasspp. andAcinetobacterspp., which produce carbapenemases of different 
      classes based on phenotypic testing. All strains ofAcinetobacter baumaniiresistant 
      to carbapenems were producers of two carbapenemase OXA-type genes (OXA-51, in 
      combination with OXA-23 (1 strain), OXA-40 (5 strains), or OXA-58 (4 strains)). The 
      metallo-β-lactamase VIM-2 type gene was detected in allPseudomonas aeruginosastrains 
      resistant to carbapenems. Testing of carbapenem-sensitive strains did not detect any 
      carbapenemase genes. The microarray method for the identification of carbapenemase 
      genes is very accurate and highly productive. It can be employed in clinical 
      microbiological laboratories for the identification and study of carbapenemase 
      epidemiology.

TI  - MALDI-TOF MS as a Tool To Detect a Nosocomial Outbreak of 
      Extended-Spectrum-β-Lactamase- and ArmA Methyltransferase-Producing Enterobacter 
      cloacae Clinical Isolates in Algeria.
PG  - 6477-83
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00615-15 [doi]
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae is among the most important pathogens responsible for 
      nosocomial infections and outbreaks. In this study, 77 Enterobacter isolates were 
      collected: 27 isolates from Algerian hospitals (in Constantine, Annaba, and Skikda) 
      and 50 isolates from Marseille, France. All strains were identified by 
      matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry 
      (MALDI-TOF MS). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the disk 
      diffusion method. PCR was used to detect extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase 
      (ESBL)-encoding, fluoroquinolone resistance-encoding, and aminoglycoside-modifying 
      enzyme (AME) genes. Epidemiological typing was performed using MALDI-TOF MS with 
      data mining approaches, along with multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Sixty-eight 
      isolates (27 from Algeria, 41 from Marseille) were identified by MALDI-TOF MS as E. 
      cloacae. Resistance to antibiotics in the Algerian isolates was significantly higher 
      than that in the strains from Marseille, especially for beta-lactams and 
      aminoglycosides. Eighteen of the 27 Algerian isolates and 11 of the 41 Marseille 
      isolates possessed at least one ESBL-encoding gene: blaCTX-M and/or blaTEM. AME 
      genes were detected in 20 of the 27 Algerian isolates and 8 of the 41 Marseille 
      isolates [ant(2″)-Ia, aac(6')-Ib-cr, aadA1, aadA2, and armA]. Conjugation 
      experiments showed that armA was carried on a transferable plasmid. MALDI-TOF typing 
      showed three separate clusters according to the geographical distribution and 
      species level. An MLST-based phylogenetic tree showed a clade of 14 E. cloacae 
      isolates from a urology unit clustering together in the MALDI-TOF dendrogram, 
      suggesting the occurrence of an outbreak in this unit. In conclusion, the ability of 
      MALDI-TOF to biotype strains was confirmed, and surveillance measures should be 
      implemented, especially for Algerian patients hospitalized in France.

TI  - R6K plasmid replication: influence of chromosomal genotype in minicell-producing 
      strains of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 1387-400
AB  - Alkaline sucrose velocity sedimentation and cesium chloride-ethidium bromide 
      equilibrium centrifugation have been used to determine the number of copies per 
      chromosomal equivalent of the relaxedly replicating R6K plasmid (a conjugative 
      plasmid conferring ampicillin and streptomycin resistance) in two minicell-producing 
      strains of Escherichia coli K-12. In one strain, the average number of covalently 
      closed circular R6K molecules per chromosomal equivalent is 13 in log-phase and 35 
      in stationary-phase cells. In the other strain, there is an average of six 
      covalently closed circular R6K molecules per chromosomal equivalent in both log- and 
      stationary-phase cells. Selection from this strain of spontaneously occurring 
      mutants resistant to high concentrations of ampicillin has been accomplished and 
      such mutants show a two- to threefold increase in the number of R6K copies per 
      chromosomal equivalent. Relative to the parental strain, mutants display the 
      following properties: (i) elevated streptomycin resistance, (ii) a 10-fold increase 
      in R6K conjugal transfer, (iii) a 10-fold increase in the amount of R6K plasmid 
      deoxyribonucleic acid segregated into minicells, and (iv) a two- to threefold 
      increase in R6K-specified beta-lactamase. The mutation(s) responsible for the 
      increase in the number of R6K molecules per chromosomal equivalent is located on the 
      bacterial chromosome. No R6K-linked mutations conferring the above phenotypes have 
      been obtained. The mutations are presumed to be in chromosomal genes which play a 
      role in the regulation of R6K replication in this strain.
